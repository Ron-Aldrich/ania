    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
        I chose to create a coffee shop website because I love drinking coffee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coffee helps me relax and feel comfortable, especially when I am studying.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coffee shops are popular among students because they are good places to study and hang out.
    </p>

    <p>
        This topic reflects my personal interest and daily lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Making this website helped me learn basic HTML and improve my creativity.
